The player will attempt to destroy the enemy Town Hall in a fast-paced game filled with thrill, challenging decisions and strategy.

### Basic Information
|                 |                                                                                               |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Genre           | RTS (Real Time Strategy)                                                                      |
| Age Range       | 12+                                                                                           |
| PEGI Info       | PEGI 12                                                                                       |
| Target Audience | All gender, 25-40-year-olds, West, Low level players, interest in medieval history & strategy |

The age minimum is set at 12 years old due to the nature of this videogame. RTS games imply resource management and long-term planning skills, making it generally more appealing for older teenagers and youngsters (even if a child can understand the mechanics of the game). 

Regarding the target audience, players have been segmented based on gender, age, region, videogame skills and general interests. People aged between 25-40 years old are considered the primary audience for RTS games, as explained earlier. When choosing a recommended level of skills, there are four posibilities: basic, low, medium and high. Troops does not require extensive experience in videogames and the mechanics are easy to learn. However, people who primarily play smartphone apps such as "Candy Crush" may feel overwhelmed due to the ammount of information and resources the player needs to manage simultaneously. This is why the level has been set to "low". Last but not least, all the marketing resources will be directed towards young people interested in medieval history (given the game's setting), resource management, brain grames and strategy.

## Lore and context
The king Aldric Stormborn of Eliora has died. There is no heir and what had been the most prosperous country of the last decades plunges abruptly into a war of secession. Its vast territory, plagued by diverse biomes, has gone from absolute tranquility to the greatest chaos seen in its history.

The people have divided and support the neighboring kings. The candidate from the northern neighbor, Azuremont, is Charles Bluebird. A smart, handsome, and very persuasive man. One should not trust his appearance, as inside he is meticulous in combat and will not miss any opportunity to seize the throne. From the south, the king of Sylveria lurks. Vincent Redwood is a huge, muscular man who will not hesitate to dismember anyone who gets in his way to the crown. The west is represented by Margaret Yellowstone, queen of Solstice. A bold, swift woman with perfect precision that instills fear in those who find themselves in her crosshairs. The east brings with it the rising sun of the kingdom of Novara. Jabari Purpleheart rules the richest country thanks to its naval trade. With wealth capable of buying any man, he will not hesitate to recruit whoever is necessary to carry out his mission.

The fate of Eliora is at stake and only war can decide it...

## Game Session Overview
The player enters the website and can choose from three different options:
1. **QUICK PLAY**: Join a lobby and wait until matched with another player. Meanwhile, they can choose their team color (blue, red, yellow, purple). Two players cannot choose the same team, as each represents one king.
2. **CREATE GAME**: Generate a code to share with a friend. Same colour rules applied as in QUICK PLAY.
3. **JOIN GAME**: Use a friend's code to join their game. Same colour rules applied as in QUICK PLAY.

The game begins, with each player spawning randomly on the map with a Town Hall and three villagers. They will progressively explore the map and gather resources to build an army, and they will attempt to destroy the opponent's Town Hall by attacking them. The game has no time limit and cannot be paused, and a player wins by destroying the oponent's Town Hall, regardless of remaining resources or soldiers. There is no point system; it's a binary win or lose outcome. After the game ends, players return to the initial menu.

## Goal
The ultimate purpose of Troops is to provide an enjoyable gaming experience for individuals during their leisure time, allowing players to engage in a game that is not overly time-consuming and does not demand advanced skills. Despite this, Troops aims to captivate players with a complexity and depth that sets it apart from basic and repetitive smartphone games.

### Dynamics
Some of the most interesting dynamics arising from the mechanics of Troops include:
- Exploring the map to familiarize oneself with it.
- Allocating all troops to maximize resource acquisition.
- Creating the largest possible army.
- Establishing non-aggression pacts, whether temporary or permanent, with opponents (friends).
- Rushing the opponent by attacking as soon as possible, leaving them with no room to develop.
- Always assigning a soldier to accompany villagers for their protection.
- Deploying troops across various fronts for offense/defense.
- Concentrating all troops on a single front to consolidate forces.
- Using only one type of attacking unit.
- Securing control of the center to monopolize gold gathering (and consequently spawning goblins).
- Negotiating with the opponent to limit the use resources (just the initial ones or others, such as forbidding the use of gold).

### Aesthetics
The overall aesthetic of the videogame is medieval-themed. Despite the game's aggressive nature, Troops aims to be a friendly and enjoyable experience for players of all kinds.
#### Graphics
The chosen art style features pixel art, suggesting a classic and easy-to-learn videogame experience, particularly suitable for novice players. Damage animations will be minimalistic, limited to health bars, to reduce the sense of violence. The color palette is not overly saturated to avoid overwhelming the player and maintain the peaceful atmosphere Troops aims to convey. The entire game will adhere to the medieval aesthetic, including the main menu, option menus, and any on-screen text, to keep the player immersed in the context and lore of Troops.
#### Music
There will be four main tracks:
- Troops' main theme, which will play in the Main Menu and Lobby.
- Village music, heard during regular gameplay to convey the peace of villagers' daily lives.
- Combat music. When a player's team initiates an attack on the opponent, both parties will hear a new action-themed track signaling the onset of battle. This alerts players and conveys the tension of the fight. After 5 seconds of inactivity between NPCs, the music will cease, returning to the village theme.
- Victory/defeat music. When a player wins or loses, the final screen will be accompanied by music appropriate to the player's outcome.

## Controls
### Keyboard
- The keys `W` `A` `S` `D` can be used to move the camera around the map.

### Mouse
- The mouse (left-click) can be used to select a NPC, a building or a resource spawner. Just by clicking on them the player will see its information (health, damage, etc) and available actions to perform.
    - While a NPC(s) is selected, right-clicking in an empty location prompts the NPC(s) to move to that position.
    - While a villager is selected, right-clicking on a source (mine/tree/sheep) prompts the villager to move there and gather the resource.
    - While a soldier or an archer is selected, right-clicking on an enemy NPC or building prompts the unit to attack.
    - While the Town Hall is selected, the player can left-click on the villager to add it to the spawning queue.
    - While a tower is selected, the player can left-click on the type of NPC (soldier/archer) that will be added to the spawning queue.- While a goblin hut is selected, the player can left-click on the goblin to add it to the spawning queue.
- The mouse can also be used to interact with the UI. The player will be able to open a menu to learn the controls, change the settings of the game (enable/disable sound, fullscreen options) or surrender and exit the current game. Navigating through the main menu and lobby will also require the use of a mouse.

## Map Design
The game currently has one map available: Desert Oasis. It features a central oasis surrounded by open terrain. Players are encouraged to launch fast attacks due to the vulnerability they face in this open environment.

## Future features
Pixl Studios is already working on new features to enrich Troops and enhance its gameplay. Here are some of the most exciting ones:

### Building
Currently, players start with a set of predefined buildings to manage their troops. Soon, they will also become architects, as they will need to send villagers to construct buildings of their choice. These buildings will require resources and take time to build. This new functionality aims not only to complicate resource management but also to introduce new dynamics that will make Troops an even better game. For example,
- Building a quaint town (just for fun).
- Using buildings as a barrier to protect the Town Hall.
- Surrounding the enemy by constructing buildings around them.

### Fog-of-war
The fog-of-war is a crucial element in RTS video games. The Pixl Studios team will add fog-of-war to allow players to explore an initially unknown map, leading to new dynamics. Another important point is that, even though the player may have explored a certain territory, they will only see the situation as it was left the last time an NPC passed through. Therefore, they will not be able to monitor the opponent's movements unless they have units specifically tasked with occupying their territory for that purpose.

### Shortcuts
Some shortcuts will be added to help our high-skilled and experienced players, such as:
- Pressing `Esc` will open the settings menu.
- While the Town Hall is selected, pressing `1` adds a villager to the spawning queue as long as the player has enough resources.
- While a tower is selected, pressing `1` adds a soldier to the spawning queue as long as the player has enough resources.
- While a tower is selected, pressing `2` adds an archer to the spawning queue as long as the player has enough resources.
- While a villager is selected, pressing `1` allows you to build a new house as long as the player has enough resources.
- While a villager is selected, pressing `2` allows you to build a new tower as long as the player has enough resources.

### New maps
Eliora is a very diverse country, and kings are about to start their fights in other biomes. Therefore, the game will soon feature three distinct maps, each equipped with a set of resource spawning points to achieve a balanced resource distribution in every game. Players can choose from these maps based on the gaming experience they seek.

The maps include:
- Desert Oasis: Today's existing map.
- River Crossing: A symmetrical map with a river running through the middle, and only 3 bridges to cross it. This design creates a high-pressure zone on the bridges, making them the primary route for attacking the opponent.
- Mountain Pass: Players spawn in a forest at one of the four corners of the map, with a very low visibility level, and limited paths to explore it. This map enables swift attacks along defined routes while offering a strategic advantage for defense, as players can anticipate the directions of potential attacks.

### Sounds
Each action performed by NPCs will have corresponding sound effects to inform the player of ongoing events. Sounds will play when villagers gather resources or build, when an NPC takes damage, or when soldiers/archers use their attacks.

### Other improvements
Last but not least, here are some future ideas to enhance the player experience:
- Drag&Drop: Players will be able to select multiple units at once by dragging the mouse, instead of selecting them one by one.
- Creator Privileges: The creator of a game will have priority in choosing color and selecting the map for the game.
- Random Spawn: Townhalls will spawn at different locations on the map.
- Lose on AFK: Players will be kicked out of the game if they remain inactive for too long.
- Population Limit: Since villagers will be able to build, villager houses will limit the maximum population of the player, adding utility to these buildings.
- Performance: Changes will be made to improve the game's performance.
