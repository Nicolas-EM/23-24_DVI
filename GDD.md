# Troops - Game Design Document
## Introduction
### Synopsis
Troops is a competitive multiplayer RTS game set in the medieval era. Two players clash on an island and must manage their resources to build a base and form an army capable of defeating their opponent. The player will attempt to destroy the enemy Town Hall in a fast-paced game filled with thrill, challenging decisions and strategy.

### Basic Information
|                 |                                                                                               |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Genre           | RTS (Real Time Strategy)                                                                      |
| Age Range       | 12+                                                                                           |
| PEGI Info       | PEGI 12                                                                                       |
| Target Audience | All gender, 25-40-year-olds, West, Low level players, interest in medieval history & strategy |

The age minimum is set at 12 years old due to the nature of this videogame. RTS games imply resource management and long-term planning skills, making it generally more appealing for older teenagers and youngsters (even if a child can understand the mechanics of the game). 

Regarding the target audience, players have been segmented based on gender, age, region, videogame skills and general interests. People aged between 25-40 years old are considered the primary audience for RTS games, as explained earlier. When choosing a recommended level of skills, there are four posibilities: basic, low, medium and high. Troops does not require extensive experience in videogames and the mechanics are easy to learn. However, people who primarily play smartphone apps such as "Candy Crush" may feel overwhelmed due to the ammount of information and resources the player needs to manage simultaneously. This is why the level has been set to "low". Last but not least, all the marketing resources will be directed towards young people interested in medieval history (given the game's setting), resource management, brain grames and strategy.

## Lore and context
The king Aldric Stormborn of Eliora has died. There is no heir and what had been the most prosperous country of the last decades plunges abruptly into a war of secession. Its vast territory, plagued by diverse biomes, has gone from absolute tranquility to the greatest chaos seen in its history.

The people have divided and support the neighboring kings. The candidate from the northern neighbor, Azuremont, is Charles Bluebird. A smart, handsome, and very persuasive man. One should not trust his appearance, as inside he is meticulous in combat and will not miss any opportunity to seize the throne. From the south, the king of Sylveria lurks. Vincent Redwood is a huge, muscular man who will not hesitate to dismember anyone who gets in his way to the crown. The west is represented by Margaret Yellowstone, queen of Solstice. A bold, swift woman with perfect precision that instills fear in those who find themselves in her crosshairs. The east brings with it the rising sun of the kingdom of Novara. Jabari Purpleheart rules the richest country thanks to its naval trade. With wealth capable of buying any man, he will not hesitate to recruit whoever is necessary to carry out his mission.

The fate of Eliora is at stake and only war can decide it...

## Game Session Overview
The player enters the website and can choose from three different options:
1. **PLAY**: Join a lobby and wait until matched with another player. Start a game on a randomly selected map (color selected by order of arrival, 1st blue and 2nd red).
2. **CREATE A GAME**: Generate a code to share with a friend. The creator can choose a map (or select "random") and the team color (blue, red, yellow, purple).
3. **JOIN A GAME**: Use a friend's code to join their game. The joiner can pick a team color, which must be different from the creator's team.

The game begins, with each player spawning randomly on the map with a Town Hall and three villagers. They will progressively explore the map and gather resources to build an army, and they will attempt to destroy the opponent's Town Hall by attacking them. The game has no time limit and cannot be paused, and a player wins by destroying the oponent's Town Hall, regardless of remaining resources or soldiers. There is no point system; it's a binary win or lose outcome. After the game ends, players return to the initial menu and can choose to play again or exit.

## Goal
The ultimate purpose of Troops is to provide an enjoyable gaming experience for individuals during their leisure time, allowing players to engage in a game that is not overly time-consuming and does not demand advanced skills. Despite this, Troops aims to captivate players with a complexity and depth that sets it apart from basic and repetitive smartphone games.

### Dynamics
Some of the most interesting dynamics arising from the mechanics of Troops include:
- Exploring the map to familiarize oneself with it.
- Building a quaint town (just for fun).
- Allocating all troops to maximize resource acquisition.
- Creating the largest possible army.
- Establishing non-aggression pacts, whether temporary or permanent, with opponents (friends).
- Rushing the opponent by attacking as soon as possible, leaving them with no room to develop.
- Using buildings as a barrier to protect the Town Hall.
- Always assigning a soldier to accompany villagers for their protection.
- Facing limited construction options due to restricted available space (on mountain maps).
- Deploying troops across various fronts for offense/defense (on desert maps).
- Concentrating all troops on a single front to consolidate forces (on desert maps).
- Exerting control over bridges to prevent enemy crossings (on river maps).
- Using only one type of troop.
- Securing control of the center to monopolize gold gathering (and consequently spawning goblins).
- Surrounding the enemy by constructing buildings around them.
- Negotiating with the opponent to limit the use resources (just the initial ones or others, such as forbidding the use of gold).

### Aesthetics
The overall aesthetic of the videogame is medieval-themed. Despite the game's aggressive nature, Troops aims to be a friendly and enjoyable experience for players of all kinds.
#### Graphics
The chosen art style features pixel art, suggesting a classic and easy-to-learn videogame experience, particularly suitable for novice players. Damage animations will be minimalistic, limited to health bars, to reduce the sense of violence. The color palette is not overly saturated to avoid overwhelming the player and maintain the peaceful atmosphere Troops aims to convey. The entire game will adhere to the medieval aesthetic, including the main menu, option menus, and any on-screen text, to keep the player immersed in the context and lore of Troops.
#### Sound
There will be four main tracks:
- Troops' main theme, which will play in the Main Menu.
- Village music, heard during regular gameplay to convey the peace of villagers' daily lives.
- Combat music. When a player's team initiates an attack on the opponent, both parties will hear a new action-themed track signaling the onset of battle. This alerts players and conveys the tension of the fight. After <T> seconds of inactivity between NPCs, the music will cease, returning to the village theme.
- Victory/defeat music. When a player wins or loses, the final screen will be accompanied by music appropriate to the player's outcome.

Additionally, each action performed by NPCs will have corresponding sound effects to inform the player of ongoing events. Sounds will play when villagers gather resources or build, when an NPC takes damage, or when soldiers/archers use their attacks.

## Controls

## Map Design
The game will feature three distinct maps, each equipped with a set of resource spawning points to achieve a balanced resource distribution in every game. Players can choose from these maps based on the gaming experience they seek.

The maps include:
- River Crossing: A symmetrical map with a river running through the middle, and only <B_Amnt> bridges to cross it. This design creates a high-pressure zone on the bridges, making them the primary route for attacking the opponent.
- Desert Oasis: This map features a central oasis surrounded by open terrain. Players are encouraged to launch fast attacks due to the vulnerability they face in this open environment.
- Mountain Pass: Players spawn in a forest at one of the four corners of the map, with a very low visibility level, and limited paths to explore it. This map enables swift attacks along defined routes while offering a strategic advantage for defense, as players can anticipate the directions of potential attacks.
